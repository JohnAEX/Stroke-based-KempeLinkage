Current next steps for conversion:
[done] add multiplicator gadget
[done] change util structure to a more class based approach (this probably should be done depending on size?)
[done]: analyse the requirements for controlling alpha / beta of the rhombus for the output point --> hint: we are restricted in resolution based on 2R of the Rhombus
[wip - needs bug fixing] add additor gadget
todo: change point based system to input/output based system
todo: allow interlinking of multiple gadgets (additor + multiplicator)
todo: use output of frontend approximation to greate additor / subtractor gadgets
todo: add translator gadget to move output point away from linkage construction
todo: avoid impossible z-axis stacking for real-life construction (? maybe)

Open questions:
* determine if all movements required to reproduce the expected path can be done easily with revolutions
